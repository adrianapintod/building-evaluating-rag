Someday, I hope, \nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn\u2019t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \nbecomes ever more important.\nTraditional software engineering \u2014 writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \nof steps to execute \u2014 has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant\u2019s staffing and supply \nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza \u2014 my favorite! \u2014 so he could make more \nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \ndata to make their lives richer.\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\n\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\n\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \ncareers in this field.

While the \nfoundations of machine learning and deep learning are maturing \u2014 \nand coursework is an efficient way to master them \u2014 beyond these \nfoundations, keeping up-to-date with changing technology is more \nimportant in AI than fields that are more mature.Learning foundational skills is a career-long process:\nThis can make it challenging to find a suitable project, estimate the project\u2019s \ntimeline and return on investment, and set expectations. In addition, the \nhighly iterative nature of AI projects leads to special challenges in project \nmanagement: How can you come up with a plan for building a system \nwhen you don\u2019t know in advance how long it will take to achieve the target \naccuracy? Even after the system has hit the target, further iteration may \nbe necessary to address post-deployment drift.Working on projects often means collaborating with \nstakeholders who lack expertise in AI:\nWhile searching for a job in AI can be similar to searching for a job in \nother sectors, there are also important differences. Many companies are \nstill trying to figure out which AI skills they need, and how to hire people \nwho have them. Things you\u2019ve worked on may be significantly different \nthan anything your interviewer has seen, and you\u2019re more likely to have to \neducate potential employers about some elements of your work.Inconsistent opinions on AI skills and jobs roles: CHAPTER 1\nAs you go through each step, you should also build a supportive community. Having friends and \nallies who can help you \u2014 and who you strive to help \u2014 makes the path easier. This is true whether \nyou\u2019re taking your first steps or you\u2019ve been on the journey for years.LEARNING\nPROJECTS\nJOB\n\nPAGE 8Learning Technical \nSkills for a Promising \nAI CareerCHAPTER 2\nLEARNING\n\nPAGE 9In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning \nfoundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported \nby being part of a community. In this chapter, I\u2019d like to dive more deeply into the first step: \nlearning foundational skills.\nMore research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when \nlearning, it\u2019s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical \ncareer in machine learning are:\nFoundational machine learning skills: For example, it\u2019s important to understand models such \nas linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly \ndetection. Beyond specific models, it\u2019s even more important to understand the core concepts \nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it\u2019s hard to excel \nin the field without some understanding of it! It\u2019s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \nsequence models, and transformers.\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \nto implement complex AI systems.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3787, "end_char_idx": 8094, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "841cfe8a-fa93-4e3a-9f0b-8ecd46b8d2e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "841cfe8a-fa93-4e3a-9f0b-8ecd46b8d2e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1fcb32a-79aa-490d-a57b-d97721dcc10f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fdc7ce9a017ce62d4e0b30cc419051a9bb56618a8569f51a2b64f8535fe6244e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7540c6ba-8ba2-4ade-9f82-42ad23c4f849", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fad795060d54a6982b0959a4711c48bd2a5e9d406e0e3a78455392fda7490ec8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "262c9917-7cc1-444c-9b88-6b59d914072f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4b68a609d833f4633db3b72f211c762e7448f9fea35fd5f3f10a0a4fb3d07f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Beyond specific models, it\u2019s even more important to understand the core concepts \nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it\u2019s hard to excel \nin the field without some understanding of it! It\u2019s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \nsequence models, and transformers.\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \nto implement complex AI systems. These skills include programming fundamentals, data \nstructures (especially those that relate to machine learning, such as data frames), algorithms \n(including those related to databases and data manipulation), software design, familiarity with \nPython, and familiarity with key libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.Math relevant to machine learning:  Key areas include linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various \nmanipulations of them) as well as probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous \nprobability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes\u2019 rule, \nand hypothesis testing). In addition, exploratory data analysis (EDA) \u2014 using visualizations and other \nmethods to systematically explore a dataset \u2014 is an underrated skill. I\u2019ve found EDA particularly \nuseful in data-centric AI development, where analyzing errors and gaining insights can really help \ndrive progress! Finally, a basic intuitive understanding of calculus will also help. The math needed \nto do machine learning well has been changing. For instance, although some tasks require calculus, \nimproved automatic differentiation software makes it possible to invent and implement new neural \nnetwork architectures without doing any calculus. This was almost impossible a decade ago.Learning Technical Skills For a Promising AI Career CHAPTER 2\n\nPAGE 10This is a lot to learn!\nEven after you master everything on this list, I hope you\u2019ll keep learning and continue to deepen \nyour technical knowledge. I\u2019ve known many machine learning engineers who benefitted from \ndeeper skills in an application area such as natural language processing or computer vision, or in \na technology area such as probabilistic graphical models or building scalable software systems.\nHow do you gain these skills? There\u2019s a lot of good content on the internet, and in theory, \nreading dozens of web pages could work. But when the goal is deep understanding, reading \ndisjointed web pages is inefficient because they tend to repeat each other, use inconsistent \nterminology (which slows you down), vary in quality, and leave gaps. That\u2019s why a good course \n\u2014 in which a body of material has been organized into a coherent and logical form \u2014 is often the \nmost time-efficient way to master a meaningful body of knowledge. When you\u2019ve absorbed the \nknowledge available in courses, you can switch over to research papers and other resources.\nFinally, no one can cram everything they need to know over a weekend or even a month. Everyone I \nknow who\u2019s great at machine learning is a lifelong learner. Given how quickly our field is changing, \nthere\u2019s little choice but to keep learning if you want to keep up.\nHow can you maintain a steady pace of learning for years? If you can cultivate the habit of \nlearning a little bit every week, you can make significant progress with what feels like less effort.Learning Technical Skills For a Promising AI Career CHAPTER 2\n\n\nPAGE 11\nThe Best Way to Build \na New Habit\nOne of my favorite books is BJ Fogg\u2019s, Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change \nEverything. Fogg explains that the best way to build a new habit is to start small \nand succeed, rather than start  too big and fail. For example, rather than trying to \nexercise for 30 minutes a day, he recommends aspiring to do just one push-up, and \ndoing it consistently.\nThis approach may be helpful to those of you who want to spend more time studying. \nIf you start by holding yourself accountable for watching, say, 10 seconds of an \neducational video every day \u2014 and you do so consistently \u2014 the habit of studying daily \nwill grow naturally. Even if you learn nothing in that 10 seconds, you\u2019re establishing the \nhabit of studying a little every day. On some days, maybe you\u2019ll end up studying for an \nhour or longer.\n\nPAGE 12Should You \nLearn Math to \nGet a Job in AI?

CHAPTER 3\nLEARNING\n\nPAGE 13Should you Learn Math to Get a Job in AI? CHAPTER 3\nIs math a foundational skill for AI? It\u2019s always nice to know more math! But there\u2019s so much to \nlearn that, realistically, it\u2019s necessary to prioritize. Here\u2019s how you might go about strengthening \nyour math background.\nTo figure out what\u2019s important to know, I find it useful to ask what you need to know to make \nthe decisions required for the work you want to do. At DeepLearning.AI, we frequently ask, \n\u201cWhat does someone need to know to accomplish their goals?\u201d The goal might be building a \nmachine learning model, architecting a system, or passing a job interview.\nUnderstanding the math behind algorithms you use is often helpful, since it enables you to \ndebug them. But the depth of knowledge that\u2019s useful changes over time. As machine learning \ntechniques mature and become more reliable and turnkey, they require less debugging, and a \nshallower understanding of the math involved may be sufficient to make them work.\nFor instance, in an earlier era of machine learning, linear algebra libraries for solving linear \nsystems of equations (for linear regression) were immature. I had to understand how these \nlibraries worked so I could choose among different libraries and avoid numerical roundoff \npitfalls. But this became less important as numerical linear algebra libraries matured.\nDeep learning is still an emerging technology, so when you train a neural network and the \noptimization algorithm struggles to converge, understanding the math behind gradient \ndescent, momentum, and the Adam  optimization algorithm will help you make better decisions. \nSimilarly, if your neural network does something funny \u2014 say, it makes bad predictions on \nimages of a certain resolution, but not others \u2014 understanding the math behind neural network \narchitectures puts you in a better position to figure out what to do.\nOf course, I also encourage learning driven by curiosity. If something interests you, go ahead \nand learn it regardless of how useful it might turn out to be!  Maybe this will lead to a creative \nspark or technical breakthrough.How much math do you need to know to be a machine learning engineer?\n\nPAGE 14Scoping Successful \nAI ProjectsCHAPTER 4\nPROJECTS\n\nPAGE 15One of the most important skills of an AI architect is the ability to identify ideas that are worth \nworking on. These next few chapters will discuss finding and working on projects so you can gain \nexperience and build your portfolio. \nOver the years, I\u2019ve had fun applying machine learning to manufacturing, healthcare, climate \nchange, agriculture, ecommerce, advertising, and other industries. How can someone who\u2019s not \nan expert in all these sectors find meaningful projects within them? Here are five steps to help \nyou scope projects.\nIdentify a business problem (not an AI problem). I like to find \na domain expert and ask, \u201cWhat are the top three things \nthat you wish worked better? Why aren\u2019t they working yet?\u201d \nFor example, if you want to apply AI to climate change, you \nmight discover that power-grid operators can\u2019t accurately \npredict how much power intermittent sources like wind \nand solar might generate in the future.\nBrainstorm AI solutions. When I was younger, I used to \nexecute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes \nthis worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing \nan even better idea that might not have taken any more \neffort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can \nbrainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, \nto predict power generation from intermittent sources, we \nmight consider using satellite imagery to map the locations \nof wind turbines more accurately, using satellite imagery \nto estimate the height and generation capacity of wind \nturbines, or using weather data to better predict cloud cover \nand thus solar irradiance. Sometimes there isn\u2019t a good AI \nsolution, and that\u2019s okay too.Scoping Successful AI Projects CHAPTER 4\nStep 1\nStep 2\n\n\nPAGE 16Determine milestones.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11342, "end_char_idx": 16016, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5709e42d-cb89-4281-9ea8-f3500fc7f06c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5709e42d-cb89-4281-9ea8-f3500fc7f06c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1fcb32a-79aa-490d-a57b-d97721dcc10f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fdc7ce9a017ce62d4e0b30cc419051a9bb56618a8569f51a2b64f8535fe6244e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "262c9917-7cc1-444c-9b88-6b59d914072f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4b68a609d833f4633db3b72f211c762e7448f9fea35fd5f3f10a0a4fb3d07f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ca3f351-332d-41e7-921e-4271b63fc4ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "879c51c30afbdde214808a59223671c3f1eea1a9873445f494881615e5ac8537", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Brainstorm AI solutions.

Once you\u2019ve deemed a project sufficiently \nvaluable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This \nincludes both machine learning metrics (such as accuracy) and \nbusiness metrics (such as revenue). Machine learning teams are often \nmost comfortable with metrics that a learning algorithm can optimize. \nBut we may need to stretch outside our comfort zone to come up \nwith business metrics, such as those related to user engagement, \nrevenue, and so on. Unfortunately, not every business problem can be \nreduced to optimizing test set accuracy! If you aren\u2019t able to determine \nreasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more \nabout the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the \nmissing perspective.Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions. You can determine \nwhether an approach is technically feasible by looking at published work, \nwhat competitors have done, or perhaps building a quick proof of concept \nimplementation. You can determine its value by consulting with domain \nexperts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the \npotential solutions mentioned above).\nBudget for resources. Think through everything you\u2019ll need to get the \nproject done including data, personnel, time, and any integrations or \nsupport you may need from other teams. For example, if you need funds \nto purchase satellite imagery, make sure that\u2019s in the budget.\nWorking on projects is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is \ninfeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding. Is there a domain \nthat excites you where AI might make a difference? I hope these steps will guide you in exploring it \nthrough project work \u2014 even if you don\u2019t yet have deep expertise in that field. AI won\u2019t solve every \nproblem, but as a community, let\u2019s look for ways to make a positive impact wherever we can.Scoping Successful AI Projects CHAPTER 4\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\n\nPAGE 17Finding Projects that \nComplement Your \nCareer GoalsCHAPTER 5\nPROJECTS\n\nPAGE 18It goes without saying that we should only work on projects that are responsible, ethical, and \nbeneficial to people. But those limits leave a large variety to choose from. In the previous chapter, \nI wrote about how to identify and scope AI projects. This chapter and the next have a slightly \ndifferent emphasis: picking and executing projects with an eye toward career development.\nA fruitful career will include many projects, hopefully growing in scope, complexity, and impact \nover time. Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to \nbigger projects as your skills grow.\nWhen you\u2019re starting out, don\u2019t expect others to hand great ideas or resources to you on a platter. \nMany people start by working on small projects in their spare time. With initial successes \u2014 even \nsmall ones \u2014 under your belt, your growing skills increase your ability to come up with better \nideas, and it becomes easier to persuade others to help you step up to bigger projects.Finding Projects that Compliment Your Career Goals CHAPTER 5\nJoin existing projects. If you find someone else with an idea, ask to join their project.\nKeep reading and talking to people. I come up with new ideas whenever I spend a lot of \ntime reading, taking courses, or talking with domain experts. I\u2019m confident that you will, too.\nFocus on an application area. Many researchers are trying to advance basic AI technology \n\u2014 say, by inventing the next generation of transformers or further scaling up language \nmodels \u2014 so, while this is an exciting direction, it is also very hard.

But the variety of \napplications to which machine learning has not yet been applied is vast! I\u2019m fortunate to \nhave been able to apply neural networks to everything from autonomous helicopter flight to \nonline advertising, partly because I jumped in when relatively few people were working on \nthose applications. If your company or school cares about a particular application, explore \nthe possibilities for machine learning. That can give you a first look at a potentially creative \napplication \u2014 one where you can do unique work \u2014 that no one else has done yet.\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713What if you don\u2019t have any project ideas?\nHere are a few ways to generate them:\n\nPAGE 19Develop a side hustle. Even if you have a full-time job, a fun project that may or may not \ndevelop into something bigger can stir the creative juices and strengthen bonds with \ncollaborators. When I was a full-time professor, working on online education wasn\u2019t part of \nmy \u201cjob\u201d (which was doing research and teaching classes). It was a fun hobby that I often \nworked on out of passion for education. My early experiences in recording videos at home \nhelped me later in working on online education in a more substantive way. Silicon Valley \nabounds with stories of startups that started as side projects. As long as it doesn\u2019t create a \nconflict with your employer, these projects can be a stepping stone to something significant.\nWill the project help you grow technically? Ideally, it should be challenging enough to \nstretch your skills but not so hard that you have little chance of success. This will put you \non a path toward mastering ever-greater technical complexity.\nDo you have good teammates to work with? If not, are there people you can discuss things \nwith? We learn a lot from the people around us, and good collaborators will have a huge \nimpact on your growth.\nCan it be a stepping stone?  If the project is successful, will its technical complexity and/\nor business impact make it a meaningful stepping stone to larger projects? If the project \nis bigger than those you\u2019ve worked on before, there\u2019s a good chance it could be such a \nstepping stone.\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713Given a few project ideas, which one should you jump into? \nHere\u2019s a quick checklist of factors to consider:\nFinally, avoid analysis paralysis. It doesn\u2019t make sense to spend a month deciding whether to \nwork on a project that would take a week to complete. You'll work on multiple projects over \nthe course of your career, so you\u2019ll have ample opportunity to refine your thinking on what\u2019s \nworthwhile. Given the huge number of possible AI projects, rather than the conventional \u201cready, \naim, fire\u201d approach, you can accelerate your progress with \u201cready, fire, aim.\u201dFinding Projects that Compliment Your Career Goals CHAPTER 5\n\nPAGE 20Working on projects requires making tough choices about what to build and how to go \nabout it. Here are two distinct styles:\nSay you\u2019ve built a customer-service chatbot for retailers, and you think it could help restaurants, \ntoo. Should you take time to study the restaurant market before starting development, moving \nslowly but cutting the risk of wasting time and resources? Or jump in right away, moving \nquickly and accepting a higher risk of pivoting or failing?\nBoth approaches have their advocates, and the best choice depends on the situation.\nReady, Aim, Fire tends to be superior when the cost of execution is high and a study can shed \nlight on how useful or valuable a project could be. For example, if you can brainstorm a few \nother use cases (restaurants, airlines, telcos, and so on) and evaluate these cases to identify \nthe most promising one, it may be worth taking the extra time before committing to a direction.\nReady, Fire, Aim tends to be better if you can execute at low cost and, in doing so, determine \nwhether the direction is feasible and discover tweaks that will make it work.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18877, "end_char_idx": 23553, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abd526e2-a622-4588-88ed-6b53833a8ad5": {"__data__": {"id_": "abd526e2-a622-4588-88ed-6b53833a8ad5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1fcb32a-79aa-490d-a57b-d97721dcc10f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fdc7ce9a017ce62d4e0b30cc419051a9bb56618a8569f51a2b64f8535fe6244e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ca3f351-332d-41e7-921e-4271b63fc4ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "879c51c30afbdde214808a59223671c3f1eea1a9873445f494881615e5ac8537", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "54cdadc1-c600-4b2f-82a3-b2a36f3ca89d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f7ef6c78f869ac82b4537512a9c942304784bf85d4bc9546adee09cd37cdec5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Should you take time to study the restaurant market before starting development, moving \nslowly but cutting the risk of wasting time and resources?

In this \ncase, the process is actually Ready, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire, Aim, Fire. \nAfter agreeing upon a project direction, when it comes to building a machine learning model \nthat\u2019s part of the product, I have a bias toward Ready, Fire, Aim. Building models is an iterative \nprocess. For many applications, the cost of training and conducting error analysis is not \nprohibitive. Furthermore, it is very difficult to carry out a study that will shed light on the \nappropriate model, data, and hyperparameters. So it makes sense to build an end-to-end \nsystem quickly and revise it until it works well.\nBut when committing to a direction means making a costly investment or entering a one-\nway door  (meaning a decision that\u2019s hard to reverse), it\u2019s often worth spending more time in \nadvance to make sure it really is a good idea.Ready, Fire, Aim\nReady, Aim, Fire: Plan carefully and carry out careful validation. Commit and \nexecute only when you have a high degree of confidence in a direction.\nReady, Fire, Aim: Jump into development and start executing. This allows you to \ndiscover problems quickly and pivot along the way if necessary.\u2713\n\u2713\n\nPAGE 21Building a Portfolio of \nProjects that Shows \nSkill Progression CHAPTER 6\nPROJECTS\n\nPAGE 22Over the course of a career, you\u2019re likely to work on projects in succession, each growing in \nscope and complexity. For example:\nThe first few projects might be narrowly scoped \nhomework assignments with predetermined right \nanswers. These are often great learning experiences!\nEventually, you will gain enough skill to build projects in \nwhich others see more tangible value. This opens the door \nto more resources. For example, rather than developing \nmachine learning systems in your spare time, it might \nbecome part of your job, and you might gain access to more \nequipment, compute time, labeling budget, or head count.You might go on to work on small-scale projects either alone or with friends. \nFor instance, you might re-implement a known algorithm, apply machine \nlearning to a hobby (such as predicting whether your favorite sports team \nwill win), or build a small but useful system at work in your spare time (such \nas a machine learning-based script that helps a colleague automate some of \ntheir work). Participating in competitions such as those organized by Kaggle \nis also one way to gain experience.\nSuccesses build on each other, opening the door to \nmore technical growth, more resources, and increasingly \nsignificant project opportunities.1.

In this chapter, I\u2019d like to focus on a framework that\u2019s useful for many job seekers in \nAI, especially those who are entering AI from a different field.\nA product manager at a tech startup who becomes a data scientist at the same company (or a \ndifferent one) has switched roles. A marketer at a manufacturing firm who becomes a marketer \nin a tech company has switched industries. An analyst in a financial services company who \nbecomes a machine learning engineer in a tech company has switched both roles and industries.\nIf you\u2019re looking for your first job in AI, you\u2019ll probably find switching either roles or industries \neasier than doing both at the same time. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re the analyst working in financial services:If you\u2019re considering your next job, ask yourself:\nJob \nSearchAre you switching roles? For example, if you\u2019re a software engineer, \nuniversity student, or physicist who\u2019s looking to become a machine learning \nengineer, that\u2019s a role switch.\nAre you switching industries? For example, if you work for a healthcare \ncompany, financial services company, or a government agency and want \nto work for a software company, that\u2019s a switch in industries.\u2713\n\u2713\nIf you find a data science or machine learning job in financial services, you can continue \nto use your domain-specific knowledge while gaining knowledge and expertise in AI. After \nworking in this role for a while, you\u2019ll be better positioned to switch to a tech company (if \nthat\u2019s still your goal).\nAlternatively, if you become an analyst in a tech company, you can continue to use your \nskills as an analyst but apply them to a different industry.

I imagined quick (three months), medium (one year), and slow (two years) recoveries \nfrom Covid-19 and made plans for managing each case. These plans have helped me prioritize \nwhere I can.\nThe same method can apply to personal life, too. If you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll pass an exam, get a \njob offer, or be granted a visa \u2014 all of which can be stressful \u2014 you can write out what you\u2019d \ndo in each of the likely scenarios. Thinking through the possibilities and following through on \nplans can help you navigate the future effectively no matter what it brings.\nBonus: With training in AI and statistics, you can calculate a probability for each scenario. \nI\u2019m a fan of the Superforecasting methodology, in which the judgments of many experts are \nsynthesized into a probability estimate.

Customize your communications with each company \nto explain why you\u2019re a good fit. Before an interview, ask the recruiter what to expect.

Outrage spreads faster than reasonableness on social media, so a story about \nhow an employer underpaid someone gets amplified, whereas stories about how an employer \ntreated someone fairly do not. The vast majority of employers are ethical and fair, so don\u2019t let \nstories about the small fraction of mistreated individuals sway your approach. If you\u2019re leaving \na job, exit gracefully.

It\u2019s tempting to take a position because of the projects you\u2019ll work \non. But the teammates you\u2019ll work with are at least equally important. We\u2019re influenced by \npeople around us, so your colleagues will make a big difference. For example, if your friends \nsmoke, the odds increase that you, too, will smoke. I don\u2019t know of a study that shows this, \nbut I\u2019m pretty sure that if most of your colleagues work hard, learn continuously, and build AI \nto benefit all people, you\u2019re likely to do the same. (By the way, some large companies won\u2019t \ntell you who your teammates will be until you\u2019ve accepted an offer. In this case, be persistent \nand keep pushing to identify and speak with potential teammates. Strict policies may make it \nimpossible to accommodate you, but in my mind, that increases the risk of accepting the offer, \nas it increases the odds you\u2019ll end up with a manager or teammates who aren\u2019t a good fit.)\nGet help from your community. Most of us go job hunting only a small number of times in our \ncareers, so few of us get much practice at doing it well. Collectively, though, people in your \nimmediate community probably have a lot of experience. Don\u2019t be shy about calling on them. \nFriends and associates can provide advice, share inside knowledge, and refer you to others \nwho may help. I got a lot of help from supportive friends and mentors when I applied for my \nfirst faculty position, and many of the tips they gave me were very helpful.\nI know that the job-search process can be intimidating. Instead of viewing it as a great leap, \nconsider an incremental approach. Start by identifying possible roles and conducting a handful \nof informational interviews. If these conversations tell you that you have more learning to do \nbefore you\u2019re ready to apply, that\u2019s great! At least you have a clear path forward. The most \nimportant part of any journey is to take the first step, and that step can be a small one.Finding the Right AI Job For You CHAPTER 9\n\nPAGE 34Keys to Building a \nCareer in AICHAPTER 10\nJOBS\n\nPAGE 35Keys to Building a Career in AI CHAPTER 10\nThe path to career success in AI is more complex than what I can  cover in one short eBook. \nHopefully the previous chapters will give you momentum to move forward. \nHere are additional things to think about as you plot your path to success: \nWhen we tackle large projects, we succeed better by \nworking in teams than individually.
